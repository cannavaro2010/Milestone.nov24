                        <p class="card-text">Britain is set to feel “much colder” as Met Office maps have indicated that a frosty sub-zero chill is preparing to take over the nation.

                            After a few weeks of milder weather conditions, the national forecaster has warned that there is an “increasing risk of rain and snow”.

                            Now that the "anticyclonic gloom" has shifted, colder air will be permitted to sweep the nation in the second half of November.
                            
                            
                            Last week, the country faced high-pressure which brought grey skies - but now this is set to to change as Britons are advised to wrap up warm.

                            Temperatures will dip below freezing in some parts of Scotland in areas near Edinburgh and Glasgow on TuesdayMet Office
                            To begin with, the Met Office has forecast that “hazy spells of sunshine” will be substituted with “cloud and patchy rain across northern and western parts” tonight.
                            
                            The far north is predicted to be battered by “scattered wintry blustery showers” and will settle down with “clear spells leading to a cold and frosty night”.
                            
                            Higher ground in the north is due to see some heavy rain and possibly snow, while the wider country might see some snowfall covering later on in the week.
                            
                            On the whole, the week ahead is set to be “colder and windier” with “frosty mornings” with temperatures dipping below freezing in some parts of Scotland in areas near Edinburgh and Glasgow.

                            Temperatures across the country will drop particularly after this weekend as icy winds are predicted to make some northern areas feel close to -10C.
                            
                            Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: “By Monday, the most likely set up is a cold northerly wind which, passing over relatively warm seas, will pick up moisture and instability and lead to frequent showers which could come as far as the southwest of England and parts of Wales, and they will be a mixture of rain sleet and snow.
                            
                            “The further north you are and how high up you are the more likely you are to see sleet and snow with any settling snow over the tops of the hills for England and Wales and Scotland and northern Ireland.
                            
                            “An increasingly cold wind will bring frequent showers to Scotland and northern Ireland, and it will be cold enough for some sleet and snow especially over higher ground.”</p>
                            Despite snow being mentioned across several forecasters, McGivern has said that “exciting maps” plastered across social media must be approached with caution.

                            He said: “These may show various parts of the UK plastered in snow by the start of next week, but it’s important to remember when looking at those maps that they are just one computer model simulation of the atmosphere, and professional meteorologists run the computer models dozens of times.”
                            
                            Still, this winter might see an abnormal amount of snowfall, as ocean temperatures remain higher than average. When frosty air sweeps over warmth and moisture, the water could turn into snow.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">On November 24, 2024By Littum
                            Russia launched a major drone strike on Kiev overnight, with Volodymyr Zelenskyy warning that the attack shows his capital needs better air defenses.
                            
                            Ukraine’s air defense units shot down 50 of 73 Russian drones launched, with no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the strikes.
                            
                            Russia has used more than 800 guided aerial bombs and about 460 attack drones in the past week.
                            
                            Warning that Ukraine needs to improve its air defense, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: “An air alert has been issued almost daily across Ukraine this week”.
                            
                            “Ukraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state.
                            
                            “But Russia still continues its efforts to kill our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us.”
                            
                            Russia did not comment on the attack.
                            
                            It comes as Russian media reported that Colonel General Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the country’s southern military district, had been removed from his role for allegedly providing misleading reports on the progress of his troops.
                            
                            While Russian forces have advanced at the fastest rate in Ukraine since the start of the invasion, forces have been much slower around Siversk and the eastern Donetsk region.

                            Russia’s Defense Ministry has not commented on the reports.

                        <h5 class="card-title">Fresh weather warnings as UK hit by cold snap</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Freezing temperatures and snowfall continued across parts of the UK on Wednesday morning after weather warnings covered all four nations.

                            Yellow warnings for ice and snow were prompted by the first snowfall of the season, which caused more than 200 schools to close on Tuesday. New warnings were announced for parts of the UK going into Thursday and the weekend.
                            
                            Icy conditions led to warnings vehicles could be stranded, power cuts may occur and rural areas could be cut off.
                            
                            National Rail advised passengers to check their journey before travelling.
                            Temperatures widely dropped to between -1C (30.2F) and -4C (24.8F) across the UK on Wednesday morning, getting as low as -7.8C the Grampians, Scotland, and -7C in Shap, Cumbria.

                            Further heavy snow fell in northern Scotland overnight, while north Wales and the midlands also woke up to fresh snow on the ground.
                            
                            Yellow weather warnings were in place for parts of all UK nations early on Wednesday, signalling likely disruption to travel and a danger of slips and falls on icy ground.
                            
                            A new warning for ice will kick in at 16:00 for most of Scotland as well as much of mid and north Wales, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands, the north of England and Northern Ireland.
                            
                            This will last until 10:00 on Thursday.
                            
                            Parts of northern Scotland and its west coast are covered by snow and ice warnings until 12:00 on Thursday.
                            Meanwhile, a yellow warning for snow will come into force in much of South West England at 05:00 on Thursday, lasting until 15:00.

                            On Wednesday, nearly 100 schools and nurseries were shut in Scotland as well as almost 50 in Wales and at least 30 in England due to frosty conditions.
                            
                            Commuters were advised to plan ahead and take extra care while driving.
                            
                            In Cornwall, a person was taken to hospital after a four-vehicle crash in icy conditions, police said.
                            
                            Elsewhere in Aberdeenshire, a bus ended up on its side in icy road conditions in the New Leeds area on Tuesday. There were no injuries.
                            
                            The RAC said it had seen a sharp rise in breakdowns, mostly due to people's batteries failing in the cold.
                            
                            It urged drivers to travel prepared for a breakdown.
                            
                            "A blanket, warm waterproof coat and gloves, sturdy footwear and a charging cable and mobile power bank are all essentials," said spokeswoman Alice Simpson.
                            
                            Transport for Wales said 13% of its rail services had been disrupted by severe weather, while crashes were reported on snowy roads.
                            
                            In north Wales, trains were suspended between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog until about 07:30 on Wednesday, while a road in Wrexham was blocked by a lorry stuck in snow.
                            
                            Northern Ireland avoided the worst of the snow, but Translink warned of disruption to some services in the Magherafelt and Cookstown areas, including school routes, due to road conditions.
                            
                            ScotRail said it was struggling to source rail replacement transport due to the weather, after a fallen tree caused disruption to some services in and out of Aberdeen - but tickets were valid on existing Stagecoach North services.
                            
                            A raft of services were disrupted on the Merseyrail train network, while road disruptions were reported in parts of North Yorkshire.
                            
                            North Yorkshire Police earlier reported the A169 Sleights to Whitby, A171 Fylingdales, A171 north of Whitby and A174 Whitby towards Guisborough were all impassable, but have said the roads were open and "passable with care" on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
